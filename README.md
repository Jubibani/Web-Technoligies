# `Meet Cleanie And Quickie`

- `"Cleanie"` is a `bat. file` that cleans your computer’s unnecessary files if executed.
- `"Quickie"` is also a `bat. file` but opens up your Chrome web page with your necessary sites. making you work-ready and boosting your productivity.

# `Why make this?`

- Working is a hobby of mine but I also have leisure to play games. that’s when I need to clean and delete the trash from `temp`, `%temp%`, and `prefetch`, and then delete it again from the `recycle bin`. — which is a hassle so I made `"Cleanie"`.
- Whether I go to class or learn from home, I have to open up and log in again to certain sites for my needed tools which is quite a hassle especially when going to school! —so I made `"Quickie"`

I reckon it would be best to leave repetitive tasks to automation to be able to do more important things, save time, and be productive.

1. `Batch scripts (**.bat** files)` —are indeed primarily used for automating tasks on your local computer within the Windows command-line environment. They're suitable for basic scripting tasks and system administration on Windows.
2. **`PowerShell scripts`** —PowerShell is more powerful than batch scripting and offers more capabilities, including interacting with web services, managing Windows components, and handling more complex tasks. PowerShell scripts (**`.ps1`** files) can interact with web services, perform remote management tasks, and integrate with other Microsoft technologies.

**So, to clarify:**

- Batch scripts are limited in their capabilities compared to PowerShell.
- PowerShell scripts are indeed more powerful and versatile, and they can interact with web services among other things.
- PowerShell is designed to replace and enhance the functionality of older command-line interfaces like batch scripting in the Windows ecosystem.

## `It Depends on you`

- **`Choose Batch scripts`** —If you need to perform simple, local automation tasks on Windows, such as file manipulation, basic system administration, or running a series of commands sequentially, batch scripts can be effective and straightforward.
- **`PowerShell scripts`** —If your tasks involve more complex operations, such as interacting with web services, managing system configurations, handling advanced data processing, or performing remote administration tasks, PowerShell provides a more powerful and flexible scripting environment.
