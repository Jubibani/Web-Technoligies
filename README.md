# Overview

These activities came from `Freecodecamp` to have a great foundation on Responsive web design. 

here I learned about :

- `html`
- `css`
- `web responsiveness`
- `github pages`
- `git`

but learning does not stop there — currently I am in `JavaScript and Data Structures`. This repository will be added until I complete all lessons that `Freecodecamp` has to offer. 

# Reminder

I have committed myself to a career that requires a lifelong journey. so —> always be `curious` , `learn`, `apply` , `build` and `share`.
