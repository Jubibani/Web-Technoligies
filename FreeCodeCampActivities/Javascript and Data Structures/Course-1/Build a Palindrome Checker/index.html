        <p id = "palindrome-meaning">A <strong>palindrome</strong> is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. To identify a palindrome, you can simply read the word or phrase in reverse and see if it matches the original sequence. If it does, then it is a palindrome. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>
